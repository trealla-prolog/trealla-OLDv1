Trealla Prolog
==============

A compact, efficient Prolog interpreter with
[ISO compliant](https://trealla-prolog.github.io/trealla/) aspirations.

	MIT licensed
	Integers are unbounded
	Atoms are UTF-8 of unlimited length
	The default double-quoted representation is *chars* list
	Dynamic atoms are automatically garbage collected
	Unlimited arity (system resources constrained)
	Uses 1st & 2nd arg indexing
	Atom garbage collection
	DCGs
	REPL with history
	Compiles in <1s with *tcc*, or ~5s with *gcc* and *clang*
	Runs on Linux, FreeBSD and macOS
	Foreign function interface (FFI) for calling out to user C code
	Access SQLITE databases using builtin module (uses FFI)
	Attributed variables with SICStus interface (*WIP*)
	Rational trees aka. cyclic terms (*WIP*)
	Logtalk compatible (*WIP*)


Trealla is not WAM-based. It uses tree-walking, structure-sharing and
deep-binding. Source is compiled to an AST that is interpreted at
runtime.

Usage
=====

	tpl [options] [files] [-- args]

where options can be:

	-O0, --noopt       - no optimization
	-f file            - load file (*~/.tplrc* not loaded)
	-l file            - load file (*~/.tplrc* loaded)
	file               - load file (*~/.tplrc* loaded)
	-g goal            - query goal (only used once)
	--library path     - alt to TPL_LIBRARY_PATH env variable
	-t, --trace        - trace
	-q, --quiet        - quiet mode (no banner)
	-v, --version      - version
	-h, --help         - help
	-d, --daemonize    - daemonize
	-w, --watchdog     - create watchdog
	--consult          - consult from STDIN

For example:

	tpl -g test2,halt samples/sieve

Invocation without any goal presents the REPL.

The default path to the library is relative to the executable location.

The file *~/.tplrc* is consulted on startup unless the *-f* option is present.

When consulting, reconsulting and deconsulting files the *.pl* version
of the filename is always preferred (if not specified) when looking for a
file.

To run the Pereira benchmark suite:

	tpl -g "bench_peirera,halt" -f samples/peirera.pl


A note on UTF-8
===============

Trealla uses UTF-8 internally and this works well with modern operating
systems that are already [[1](https://www.utf8everywhere.org/)], or moving to
[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_in_Microsoft_Windows#UTF-8)],
native UTF-8.

It aligns well with standard C as functions like strcmp/memcmp that
require no special handling to respect codepoint order. This also works
seamlessly with the implementation of double-quoted *strings* (ie.
chars-list), DCGs, and mmap'd files. Any code-point specific
requirements, like *get_char*, *get_code*, *sub_atom*, *atom_length*,
*atom_codes*, *atom_chars* & *_upper/*_lower are handled on the fly.

Unicode atoms do not need to be quoted unless they contain breaking
characters...

```prolog
?- [user].
是.            % be: means, approximately, "True".
不是 :- \+ 是.  % not be: means, approximately, "False".
<CTRL-D>
   true.
?- 是.
   true.
?- 不是.
   false.
```

Trealla accepts as a variable any atom beginning with Unicode uppercase...

```prolog
?- atom_upper(δ,C).
   C = Δ.
?- Δ is 123456-123455.
   Δ = 1.
?-
```


Building
========

Written in plain-old C.

	git clone https://github.com/infradig/trealla.git
	cd trealla

On Debian+ systems you may need to install GNU readline, xxd & libffi

	sudo apt install libreadline-dev xxd libffi-dev

Then...

	make

To build without libffi:

	make NOFFI=1

Other systems may vary. On Debian+ systems you may need to install OpenSSL:

	sudo apt install libssl-dev

To build without OpenSSL:

	make NOSSL=1

To build with the included ISOCLINE sources (default is to use GNU readline):

	make ISOCLINE=1

Then...

	make test

On *BSD* systems use *gmake* to build and do

	pkg install editors/vim

to get the *xxd* utility.

For unbounded arithmetic Trealla uses a modified fork of the
[imath](https://github.com/infradig/imath)
library, which is partially included in the source. Note, unbounded
integers (aka. bigints) are for arithmetic purposes only and will give a
type_error when used in places not expected. The *imath* library has a bug
whereby printing large numbers becomes exponentially slower (100K+ digits)
and will require a switch to *libtomath* at some point to remedy.


Cross-compile for Windows
=========================

To cross-compile on Linux and produce a Windows executable...

	sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
	make CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc NOSSL=1 NOFFI=1 ISOCLINE=1

```console
$ file tpl.exe
tpl.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
$ wine tpl.exe -g test5,halt -f samples/sieve.pl
```

Acknowledgements
================

This project started in March 2020 and it would not be where it is today
without help from these people:

Special thanks to [Xin Wang](https://github.com/dram) for providing the
testing framework, for the initial push to get serious and for being
the first to take this work (in it's nascent form) seriously.

Special thanks to [Paulo Moura](https://github.com/pmoura) for his patience
and sleuthing in the quest for Trealla to run his Logtalk project.

Special thanks to [Markus Triska](https://github.com/triska) for
driving the use of packed UTF-8 strings for character-lists. For the
idea of mmap()-ing files as strings. For his rigorous approach to types
and for bug-checking. Also for use of his format_//2 library.

Special thanks to [Jos De Roo](https://github.com/josd) for his testing
against some classic Prolog examples and his EYE project.

Special thanks to [Christian Thaeter](https://github.com/cehteh) for his
work with code cleanup and development ideas.

Special thanks to [Ulrich Neumerkel](https://github.com/uwn) for his
DCG reference library, for his drive towards ISO standardization and for
being himself.


Strings
=======

Double-quoted strings, when *set_prolog_flag(double_quotes,chars)* is set
(which is the default) are stored as packed UTF-8 byte arrays. This is
compact and efficient. Such strings emulate a list representation and
from the programmer point of view are very much indistinguishable from
lists.

A good use of such strings is *open(filename,read,Str,[mmap(Ls))*
which gives a memory-mapped view of a file as a string *Ls*. List
operations on files are now essentially zero-overhead! DCG applications
will gain greatly (*phrase_from_file/[2-3]* uses this).

Both strings and atoms make use of low-overhead reflist-counted byte slices
where appropriate.

	open(stream(Str),...)       # with open/4 reopen a stream
	open(F,M,S,[mmap(Ls)])      # with open/4 mmap() the file to Ls

Note: consult/1 and load_files/2 support lists of files as args. Also
support loading into modules eg. *consult(MOD:FILE-SPEC)*.

	popen/3                     # popen(+cmd,+mode,-stream)
	popen/4                     # popen(+cmd,+mode,-stream,+opts)

Note: popen/[3,4] use the Unix popen() system call:

	tpl -g "use_module(library(apply)),popen('ps -a',read,S,[]),getlines(S,Ls),close(S),maplist(print,Ls),halt"
		PID   TTY      TIME     CMD
		2806  tty2     00:00:00 gnome-session-b
		31645 pts/0    00:00:00 tpl
		31646 pts/0    00:00:00 sh
		31647 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

Note: read_term/[2,3] supports the positions(Start,End) and the
line_counts(Start,End) property options to report file information.
This is analogous to stream_property/2 use of position(Pos) and
line_count(Line) options.


Definite Clause Grammars
========================

Uses Ulrich Neumerkel's standard reference library. DCG rules are
translated automatically as this library is auto-included.

	:- use_module(library(dcgs)).


Crypto functions
================

Hash a plain-text data string to a hexadecimal byte string
representing the cryptographic strength hashed value. The options
are *algorithm(Name)* where *Name* can be *sha256*, *sha384* or *sha512*
at the moment. If it is a variable it will be unified with the default
*sha256* algorithm. This predicate is only available when compiled
with OpenSSL...

	crypto_data_hash/3          # crypto_data_hash(+data,-hash,+options)

Convert a hexadecimal string to a byte-list. At least one arg must be
instantiated...

	hex_bytes/2                 # hex_bytes(?hash,?bytes)


HTTP 1.1
========

	:- use_module(library(http)).

	http_get/3				# http_get(Url, Data, Opts)
	http_post/4				# http_post(Url, Data, Opts)
	http_patch/4			# http_patch(Url, Data, Opts)
	http_put/4				# http_put(Url, Data, Opts)
	http_delete/3			# http_delete(Url, Data, Opts)

	http_server/2			# http_server(Goal,Opts),

	http_request/5			# http_request(S, Method, Path, Ver, Hdrs)

A server *Goal* takes a single arg, the connection stream.


Networking					##EXPERIMENTAL##
==========

	server/2                # server(+host,-stream)
	server/3                # server(+host,-stream,+list)
	accept/2                # accept(+stream,-stream)
	client/4                # client(+url,-host,-path,-stream)
	client/5                # client(+url,-host,-path,-stream,+list)

The options list can include *udp(bool)* (default is false),
*nodelay(bool)* (default is true), *ssl(bool)* (default is false)
and *certfile(filespec)*.

The additional server options can include *keyfile(filespec)* and
*certfile(filespec)*. If just one concatenated file is supplied, use
*keyfile(filespec)* only.

The optional schemes 'unix://', 'http://' (the default) and 'https://'
can be provided in the client URL.

With *bread/3* the 'len' arg can be an integer > 0 meaning return that
many bytes, = 0 meaning return what is there (if non-blocking) or a variable
meaning return all bytes until end end of file,


Foreign Function Interface (FFI)		##EXPERIMENTAL##
================================

Allows the loading of dynamic libraries and calling of foreign functions
written in C from within Prolog...

	'$dlopen'/3 			# '$dlopen(+name, +flag, -handle)

These predicates register a foreign function as a builtin and use a
wrapper to validate arg types at call/runtime...

	'$register_function'/4		# '$ffi_reg'(+handle,+symbol,+types,+ret_type)
	'$register_predicate'/4		# '$ffi_reg'(+handle,+symbol,+types,+ret_type)

The allowed types are *int8*, *int16*, *int32*, *int64*, *uint8*,
*uint16*, *uint32*, *uint64*, *fp32*, *fp64*, *cstr*, *const_cstr*
and *ptr* (for arbitrary pointers/handles).

Assuming the following C-code in *samples/foo.c*:

```c
	double foo(double x, int64_t y)
	{
		return pow(x, (double)y);
	}

	int bar(double x, int64_t y, double *result)
	{
		*result = pow(x, (double)y);
		return 0;
	}

	char *baz(const char *x, const char *y)
	{
		char *s = malloc(strlen(x) + strlen(y) + 1);
		strcpy(s, x);
		strcat(s, y);
		return s;
	}
```

```console
	$ gcc -fPIC -c foo.c
	$ gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o
```

Register a builtin function...

```prolog
	?- '$dlopen'('samples/libfoo.so', 0, H),
		'$register_function'(H, foo, [fp64, int64], fp64).
	   H = 94051868794416.
	?- R is foo(2.0, 3).
	   R = 8.0.
	?- R is foo(abc,3).
	   error(type_error(float,abc),foo/2).
```

Register a builtin predicate...

```prolog
	?- '$dlopen'('samples/libfoo.so', 0, H),
		'$register_predicate'(H, bar, [fp64, int64, -fp64], int64),
		'$register_predicate'(H, baz, [cstr, cstr], cstr),
	   H = 94051868794416.
	?- bar(2.0, 3, X, Return).
	   X = 8.0, Return = 0.
	?- baz('abc', '123', Return).
	   Return = abc123.
```

Note: the foreign function return value is passed as an extra argument
to the predicate call.

There is an example using SQLITE. First make sure SQLITE is installed
on your system, for example...

```console
	$ sudo apt install sqlite3
```

Then, given the code in *samples/sqlite3.pl*...

```prolog
	:- use_module(library(sqlite3)).

	run :-
		test('samples/sqlite3.db', 'SELECT * FROM company').

	test(Database, Query) :-
		flag('SQLITE_OK', SQLITE_OK),
		sqlite3_open(Database, Connection, Ret), Ret =:= SQLITE_OK,
		bagof(Row, sqlite3_query(Connection, Query, Row, _), Results),
		writeq(Results), nl.
```

Run...

```console
	$ tpl -g run,halt samples/sqlite3.pl
[[1,'Paul',32,'California',20000.0],[2,'Allen',25,'Texas',15000.0],[3,'Teddy',23,'Norway',20000.0],[4,'Mark',25,'Rich-Mond ',65000.0],[5,'David',27,'Texas',85000.0],[6,'Kim',22,'South-Hall',45000.0]]
```


Persistence						##EXPERIMENTAL##
===========

Declaring something dynamic with the *persist* directive:

	:- persist :predindicator

causes that clause to be saved to a per-module database on update
(asserta/assertz/retract). Maybe this should be an option to
*dynamic/2*?


Concurrency						##EXPERIMENTAL##
===========

Trealla is single-threaded internally but cooperative multitasking is
available in the form of light-weight coroutines that run until they
yield control, either explicitly or implicitly (when waiting on input
or a timer)...

	fork/0                  # parent fails, child continues
	task/[1-n]	            # concurrent form of call/1-n
	yield/0                 # voluntarily yield control
	wait/0                  # parent should wait for children to finish
	await/0                 # parent should wait for a message
	send/1                  # append rule to parent queue
	recv/1                  # pop rule from queue
	tasklist/[2-8]          # concurrent form of maplist/1-n

Note: *send/1*, *sleep/1* and *delay/1* do implied yields. As does *getline/2*,
*bread/3*, *bwrite/2* and *accept/2*.

Note: *task/n* acts as if defined as:

```prolog
	task(G) :- fork, call(G).
	task(G,P1) :- fork, call(G,P1).
	task(G,P1,P2) :- fork, call(G,P1,P2).
```
	...

In practice *task* calls a special version of *fork/0* that limits
the number of such concurrent tasks. Excess tasks will be scheduled as
tasks finish.

An example:

```prolog
:-use_module(library(http)).

geturl(Url) :-
	http_get(Url,_Data,[status_code(Code),final_url(Location)]),
	format("Job [~w] ~w ==> ~w done~n",[Url,Code,Location]).

% Fetch each URL in list sequentially...

test54 :-
	L = ['www.google.com','www.bing.com','www.duckduckgo.com'],
	maplist(geturl,L),
	writeln('Finished').

% Fetch each URL in list concurrently (method 1)...

test55 :-
	L = ['www.google.com','www.bing.com','www.duckduckgo.com'],
	maplist(task(geturl),L),
	wait,
	writeln('Finished').

% Fetch each URL in list concurrently (method 2)...

test56 :-
	L = ['www.google.com','www.bing.com','www.duckduckgo.com'],
	tasklist(geturl,L),
	writeln('Finished').
```

```console
$ tpl samples/test -g "time(test54),halt"
Job [www.google.com] 200 ==> www.google.com done
Job [www.bing.com] 200 ==> www.bing.com done
Job [www.duckduckgo.com] 200 ==> https://duckduckgo.com done
Finished
Time elapsed 0.663 secs

$ tpl samples/test -g "time(test55),halt"
Job [www.duckduckgo.com] 200 ==> https://duckduckgo.com done
Job [www.bing.com] 200 ==> www.bing.com done
Job [www.google.com] 200 ==> www.google.com done
Finished
Time elapsed 0.331 secs

$ tpl samples/test -g "time(test56),halt"
Job [www.duckduckgo.com] 200 ==> https://duckduckgo.com done
Job [www.bing.com] 200 ==> www.bing.com done
Job [www.google.com] 200 ==> www.google.com done
Finished
Time elapsed 0.33 secs
```

Multiple* high level *prolog* objects can be created and assigned to
operating system threads in a C-wrapper program by calling

```c
	prolog *pl = pl_create()
	pl_consult(pl, filename)
	pl_eval(pl, expr)
	etc.
```

Each such *prolog* instance is thread-safe. Such instances could use
Unix domain sockets for IPC.
